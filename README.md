## Project 3 - Mail

This was my submission for project 3 in the CS50 web development course. It's an email web app created in Django. 
Users can send emails and also archive and reply to emails.
All of the different mailboxes use the same HTML template. This is the first time I really used Javascript to create 
a single page application and make the site more dynamic.
